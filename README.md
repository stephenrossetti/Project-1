# Creating our Pet Treat Informer Page

## Description

- We wated to create a website where dog owners can search up common human foods they might want to feed thier dogs. We want to provide nutritional information on those foods and also give general information on it.
- We wanted to be able to have a simple website that a person can navigate to make searching for nutrition information easier. 
- The website can make it easier for people to serch if they can feed their dog a common human food without having to search through multiple pages to look for information. It will also display a warning on foods that casue harmful side effects if consumed.

## Installation

There is no special installation required. The user only has to have the link to aces the website.

## Usage

The page includes two boxes where the user will input their dogs name in one box and the weight in the other. The user will be able to select a food item from the list provided in a different box. Saving the profile will be helpful to the users that want to keep their information for future uses, and they can also delete their profile if they no longer want it saved.
